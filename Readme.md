01 => variables are a storage that are created in the memory to store the data, console.table([...]) => helps in printing all the variables or data in one go

var is not used because of the nowadays because, of the issue in block scope and functional scope and  we use let 

when a function or variable is declared and left without any input or data then, they are stated as undefined in the compiler 

02 => for javaScript standard documentation we can use ecma script 
https://www.ecmascript.org/docs-dev/

03 => We can change check the variable data type by using the 'typeof' function inside the console, for data type conversion of the variable, we use (Number, String) function within the variable [let valueInNumber = Number(score);]

Note : in javaScript the executions follows line by line and across horizontly i.e why console.log(1+1+ "2") => 22 , since the first two are integers itself they get calculated at first, only after that calculted with string , another example is console.log("2" + 1 + 1) => 211 since the first value itself is the string the whole remaining value explicitly gets changed to string by js. 

paraenthsis is important in using operations the right way 

 for prefix and post fix => mdn.com

while using prefix the value is already incremented and returned before it performs increment

while using postfix the value increments and returns the value after incrementing
