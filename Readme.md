01 => variables are a storage that are created in the memory to store the data, console.table([...]) => helps in printing all the variables or data in one go

var is not used because of the nowadays because, of the issue in block scope and functional scope and  we use let 

when a function or variable is declared and left without any input or data then, they are stated as undefined in the compiler 

02 => for javaScript standard documentation we can use ecma script 
https://www.ecmascript.org/docs-dev/

03 => We can change check the variable data type by using the 'typeof' function inside the console, for data type conversion of the variable, we use (Number, String) function within the variable [let valueInNumber = Number(score);]
